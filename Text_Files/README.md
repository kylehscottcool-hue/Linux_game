# Linux_game


This is a platformer game made on the Omarchy Linux distro.

# ABOUT ME 
I am a 13 year old kid that is really interested in software development. I am looking to find a job later on as a pilot or game developer. I decided that I didn't want to wait around until high-school or college, so I started now. I first started on Windows 10 with my desktop pc, making some basic python and HTML, CSS, JS websites. I eventually decided that web development just wasn't really my thing, so I switched to game development. I started developing this game in VS-Code. This game right now has come so far from where I started. When I tried to install Omarchy linux, I realized that Omarchy wasn't dual-bootable on the same drive like I wanted it to be, so I literally wiped my entire Windows OS, and my recovery point was usesless. I didn't give up however. I started using neo vim, because I liked the way that I could navigate fast, while also still being in the terminal. I use GEMINI TERMINAL to help with unsolvable bugs and error codes that show up due to my crappy pygame install. GEMINI was a life-saver when it came to me fixing the stupid font corrupting. Anyway, I restarted making my stuff from my outdated github repository that is now private. I eventaully made it into what it is now.

# PLAN FOR THIS GAME
I know I can't do much in terms of creating a fully fledged game with pygame. That is why I am looking to learn another game engine, but that is far in the future. Don't worry, this game will never go private, and I might even put a liscence on it later on once I start working on it. For now, this is free to download and use, you just cannot copy and redistribute the code. I don't know if I am allowed to say that as of now since I have ZERO liscence on this repository.

# COMMIT SCHEDULE
During the school year, I plan to do daily commits at around 6-7 o'clock in the afternoon. If my school work is too much, I might just make a change to the PLAN. I will make weekly changes to the PLAN, and I will have notes in every commit stating what I did to the code (will also be in the changelog), and what I am planning to do in the next commits. At the end of each week, I will compile what I did that week, and what I plan to do the next week into the CHANGELOG file with timestamps. The PLAN file is for long-term plans for this game like large features, collaborations, and non-game related content and ideas that I have. The PLAN file will be empty for a while, until I get more people to work on this with me, and more support from the community

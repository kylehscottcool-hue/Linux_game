Posting on a Sunday. Last week, I installed linux, and started creating this game. You can find a more detailed description of how things went down in the README.md file. I created the base of the first 2 levels on Saturday, 11/01/2025. Today, I created a nicer color palette, and a main page where you can select levels.

I plan to add a menu button in the top right of each level that will bring you back to the main screen, and I also plan to add a third level with a slanted platform that you will slide down if you don't jump repeatedly, or use a powerup. I can't decide between powerup and jumping, but since this game is based on powerups, I will probably go with the powerup. I also plan to add a page detailing every powerup, and element in the game as a basic tutorial. Tomorrow is Monday, so there probably won't be any major changes, maybe some tweaks and bug fixes.

I couldn't wait, so I added a menu button, text at the top that displays the level, and a back button that goes to the previous level.

I am looking forward to creating level 3, and making it to where you cannot access a level until you have completed the level before it.

This commit just added a Universal.py file in order for there to be a quick and easy copy and paste for any new level that I create. I know that this won't work for any menu files, but it will have to do.

This commit added more integration and universal use for the Unversal.py file. We also added the level_3.py file that is a level with 2 platforms, and a key to unlock the portal.

This commit adds 2 new levels. Level 3 adds multiple platforms and a key. Level 4 blends all powerups and features from previous levels into one level. These changes are great, and level 4 uses an abs collision system.

This commit added the file "level_5.py", but didn't really do anything inside of the file. I am still trying to figure out how to add sloped platforms, as that is the idea for this next level.

This commit adds some new logic to "level_5.py", but also didn't really add much. These slopes and collision logic is confusing, especially because I am teaching myself.
